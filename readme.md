# T.E.S.

### Theion Eidolon Socors 

At its core, the T.E.S. is a simple, yet powerful, tool which helps users understand (nearly) any resource.

## Overview
---
Integral components of T.E.S. are:
- A server, which hosts an LLM, and generates responses as a simple API
- A client, qhich sends a query
- A query, which consists of URL's and/or Files, and a question asked by a human.
- A resonse, which is a helpful answer from a personable assistant acting as an expert in whatever field the user's question pertained to.

## Accessibility / Ease of use
This project is intended to further the total knowledge of humanity, and as such needs to be as accessible and user-friendly as possible.

A means to this end, the T.E.S. ecosystem (T.E.S.e.):
- ðŸ“± IOS client, which along with accepting the normal text-based input, also allows you to record audio.
- ðŸ“± Android client, which along with accepting the normal text-based input, also allows you to record audio.
- ðŸ’» Web client. 
- ðŸ’¬ SMS-based interaction.
- ðŸ“§ Email-based interaction.

### More Servers?
As a solo developer I am burdened with limited server availability. As such, at some point in the future it might become feasible to implement a decentralized multi-server system wherein anybody can host an API instance, and clients connect to whichever server has the least load, or response time, or optimize certain model parameters, etc.
